								<p>This report examines the global trends and patterns of shark attacks, highlighting the most affected regions, times of day, and species involved. By understanding these factors, we can better appreciate the importance of shark conservation and take steps to minimize the risk of encounters gone wrong. <br>Key Insights: <br>- 2015 had the highest number of reported shark attacks. <br>-1900 had the lowest number of reported shark attacks. <br>-Morning had the highest number of reported shark attacks. <br>-White sharks attacked more people compared to other species. <br> RECOMMENDATIONS <br>-Be aware of your surroundings: When surfing, swimming, or engaging in water activities, pay attention to your environment and watch for sharks. <br>-Avoid peak shark hours: Since most attacks occur in the morning, consider adjusting your water activities to later in the day. <br>-Stay in groups: When swimming or surfing, stay with a group of people. Sharks are less likely to attack a group than a solo individual. <br>-Don't enter the water with open wounds: Sharks can detect blood and other bodily fluids, which may attract them to you. <br>-Avoid wearing shiny jewelry: Sharks may be attracted to shiny objects, so it's best to avoid wearing jewelry while in the water.</p>
